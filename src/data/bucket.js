/**
 * The `Bucket` interface is the single point of knowledge about turning vector
 * tiles into WebGL buffers.
 *
 * `Bucket` is an abstract interface. An implementation exists for each style layer type.
 * Create a bucket via the `StyleLayer#createBucket` method.
 *
 * The concrete bucket types, using layout options from the style layer,
 * transform feature geometries into vertex and index data for use by the
 * vertex shader.  They also (via `ProgramConfiguration`) use feature
 * properties and the zoom level to populate the attributes needed for
 * data-driven styling.
 *
 * Buckets are designed to be built on a worker thread and then serialized and
 * transferred back to the main thread for rendering.  On the worker side, a
 * bucket's vertex, index, and attribute data is stored in `bucket.arrays:
 * ArrayGroup`.  When a bucket's data is serialized and sent back to the main
 * thread, is gets deserialized (using `new Bucket(serializedBucketData)`, with
 * the array data now stored in `bucket.buffers: BufferGroup`.  BufferGroups
 * hold the same data as ArrayGroups, but are tuned for consumption by WebGL.
